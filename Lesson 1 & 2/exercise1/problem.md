## Write an algorithm for the following problem:
* Problem: Given a list of positive numbers, return the largest number on the list.
* Inputs: A list L of positive numbers. This list must contain at least one number. (Asking for the largest number in a list of no numbers is not a meaningful question.)
* Outputs: A number n, which will be the largest number of the list.
